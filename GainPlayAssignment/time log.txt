The player needs to reach a goal area or checkpoint before a timer runs out and picks up points along the way. 
The difficulty should slowly increase during the level.
If the player finishes the level they need to be prompted to play again. 

Bonus:
If you complete the exercise early, you can implement a way to add hand crafted chunks of
obstacles to the game.
