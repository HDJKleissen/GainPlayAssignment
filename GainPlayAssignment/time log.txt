Groups of obstacles are spawned randomly.
The player needs to reach a goal area or checkpoint before a timer runs out and picks up points along the way. 
The difficulty should slowly increase during the level.
Please create about 30 seconds or longer of play with some puzzles using these ingrediënts to show off the functionality you created.
If the player finishes the level they need to be prompted to play again. 

Once the game is ended, the player dies, or the level is finished by the player, the gamecontroller must save a .json file
that contains the following information:
● The name of the game
● The time played in seconds
● The timecode of when the score file was generated
● The score the player earned
{
"timePlayed": 83,
"timeJsonMade": 1662035655,
"gameName": "blocky-pushy",
"score": 1337
}
Bonus:
If you complete the exercise early, you can implement a way to add hand crafted chunks of
obstacles to the game.
